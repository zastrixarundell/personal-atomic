# Enable TCP Fast Open
# TCP Fast Open is an extension to the transmission control protocol (TCP) that helps reduce network latency
# by enabling data to be exchanged during the senderâ€™s initial TCP SYN [3].
# Using the value 3 instead of the default 1 allows TCP Fast Open for both incoming and outgoing connections:
net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen = 3

# TCP Enable ECN Negotiation for both outgoing and incoming connections
net.ipv4.tcp_ecn = 1

# TCP Reduce performance spikes
# Refer https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_real_time/7/html/tuning_guide/reduce_tcp_performance_spikes
net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0

# Increase netdev receive queue
# May help prevent losing packets
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 16384

# Disable TCP slow start after idle
# Helps kill persistent single connection performance
net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle = 0

# Protect against tcp time-wait assassination hazards, drop RST packets for sockets in the time-wait state. Not widely supported outside of Linux, but conforms to RFC:
net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337 = 1
